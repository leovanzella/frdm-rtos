This project is a direct imlementation of the Freescale(acquired by NXP) [freedom board](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/kinetis-cortex-m-mcus/l-seriesultra-low-powerm0-plus/freedom-development-platform-for-kinetis-kl14-kl15-kl24-kl25-mcus:FRDM-KL25Z) FRDM-KL25Z and [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org).

Just basics and it's great for learning about real-time operational systems with a cheap board.
